hello people.

this is just a backup in case someone deletes some of the files.

it won't work because of Windows Defender SmartScreen but it'll make us feel better.
:/

Microsoft Defender SmartScreen protects against phishing or malware websites and applications, and the downloading of potentially malicious files.

Microsoft Defender SmartScreen determines whether a site is potentially malicious by:

Analyzing visited webpages and looking for indications of suspicious behavior. If Microsoft Defender SmartScreen determines that a page is suspicious, it shows a warning page to advise caution.
Checking the visited sites against a dynamic list of reported phishing sites and malicious software sites. If it finds a match, Microsoft Defender SmartScreen shows a warning to let the user know that the site might be malicious.
Microsoft Defender SmartScreen determines whether a downloaded app or app installer is potentially malicious by:

Checking downloaded files against a list of reported malicious software sites and programs known to be unsafe. If it finds a match, Microsoft Defender SmartScreen shows a warning to let the user know that the site might be malicious.
Checking downloaded files against a list of files that are well known and downloaded frequently. If the file isn't on that list, Microsoft Defender SmartScreen shows a warning, advising caution.


basically we can't download and run it from here.
